            <h3 class="title is-6">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p class=>
                Emotional intelligence (or EQ - Emotional Quotient) involves being aware of your own emotions and how
                they affect those around you.
                It also involves being aware of others emotions and being able to respond appropriately to them.
            </p>

            <p class="padding-2">
                According to Daniel Goleman (author of 'Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More than IQ'), there
                are five categories of Emotional Intelligence:
            </p>

            <ul class="margin-bottom">
                <li>Self-Awareness: understanding your own emotions and behaviours</li>
                <li>Self-Regulation: the ability to monitor and control your emotions and behaviours</li>
                <li>Motivation: a willingness to work towards long-term success</li>
                <li>Empathy: being aware of the feelings and emotions of other people</li>
                <li>Social skills: ability to build relationships with others</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title is-6">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>
                Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a score derived from a standardised test designed to measure intelligence,
                which represents cognitive ability as compared to the general population.
            </p>

            <p class="padding-2">
                IQ may represent abilities including:
            </p>
            <ul class="margin-bottom">
                <li>Visuospatial ability</li>
                <li>Logical reasoning</li>
                <li>Language skills</li>
                <li>Mathematical skills</li>
                <li>Memory ability</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Why is it important?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                Emotional intelligence has been linked to success through qualities such as
                perseverance, self-control, self-confidence and the ability to get on well with others.
                Those with higher EQs are also better able to understand, express and regulate their own emotions - so
                it is no surprise that emotional intelligence has also been linked to increased happiness.
                The ability to relate to those around them also lends to the formation and maintenance of positive relationships.
                Individuals with a high EQ are also better able to adapt to change and work well in teams,
                and is a key distinguishing factor in those who excel in the workforce.
