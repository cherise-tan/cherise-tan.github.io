        <div class="blog-posts-body">
            <h3 class="title is-6">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I have a position lined up to start at the beginning of February 2020, and it is my goal to be job-ready
                at this time. After this, it is actually my intention to not have a long-term career plan. I have been
                on a long-term career progression pathway up until this time, and would like to take the time to forge
                my own path. In my new role next year, I will be rotating through four different departments at my new
                company,
                and I would like to choose my onward career path based on my experience in these different technology
                fields.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                I am a driven and fast learner who loves solving problems, which will help me along my learning journey
                as I pick up new concepts and technologies. I am also highly adaptable and used to a constantly changing
                environment, which I believe will also aid me during Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I do find that I have a strong need to prove myself and to excel in whatever I do, across all aspects of
                my life. While this drives me to succeed, it can also lead to significant stress and burnout, and to
                fluctuations in self-esteem when things don't pan out quite as intended. Having experienced burnout in
                my previous career, I am aware that this is something I am susceptible to - and I am setting goals
                around prioritising self-care because of this.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">What skills would you like to see developed in
                yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I would like to grow my skills in developing projects as a member of a team. Most of my experience to
                date has been in the creation and development of my own personal projects, so this is something that I
                have had limited exposure to. As part of this I would like to be more comfortable when working with
                other people's code - a crucial skill as I move into a professional capacity working with large
                codebases. I would also like to prepare myself as much as possible for dealing with imposter syndrome,
                which I believe I will experience as I enter the workforce - especially entering a grad program in which
                the
                majority of my cohort will have completed Computer Science or Software Engineering degrees.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I expect to be stretched throughout my time in Bootcamp, and also to learn in a supportive and friendly
                environment.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                I feel that my challenge during this programme will be in finding balance between my studies and my
                personal life. I am aware that I am prone to burnout, so focusing on self-care will be a top priority
                for me as I progress through this course. I am hopeful that having some job security will allow me to
                study in a healthier way - enjoying the challenge rather than becoming stressed by it.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I am a dance teacher/business owner, and will need to have Tuesday evenings away from the course/my
                computer in order to run classes. I will also need a few weekends off - for a combination of dance
                events and a wedding. I will ensure that I work more hours around these times if required to complete my
                course work.
