        <div class="blog-posts-body">
            <h3 class="title is-6">Describe a time you got blocked on a simple problem and solved it in an elegant way
            </h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                A problem that comes to mind is the <em>deBee()</em> function from the Built-In Methods kata.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-bottom-1">
                Step 1 was to inspect the string that was passed to the function. This was important to get some idea
                about the data that I was dealing with. <code>console.log(str)</code> revealed
                strings containing multiple "buzz" words.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-bottom-1">
                Step 2 was to write some pseudocode. First I needed to convert the string to an array, allowing me
                to use the inbuilt JavaScript <code>array.filter()</code> method to filter out all the "buzz" words.
                Console.logging had revealed that some of the "buzz" words had different capitalisation (e.g. BUzz,
                BuZZ) - so I needed to find some way to account for this (as 'B' and 'b' will be evaluated as
                different characters when it comes to comparing for equality). Then I would need to convert the array
                back into a string to fulfill the test requirements.

            </p>
            <p class="padding-bottom-1">
                Step 3 was googling. I needed to work out how to actually use the <code>array.filter()</code> function.
                I considered using a regular expression to account for case sensitivity, but ultimately decided
                it was simpler to just convert the entire word to lowercase - i.e. <code>word.toLowerCase()</code>

            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                Step 4 - actually write the code! By planning out my solution over the previous steps, I was
                actually able to solve the problem quite simply.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">My Favourite Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                <b>Trying something</b>: This is typically my first port of call when I encounter a problem. If I have a
                hunch about how to solve something (and the problem is relatively simple), I will just go ahead and try
                to
                implement my hypothesis. If this doesn't work, the problem is a bit more complicated, or I have no idea
                how to approach it - it's time to move on to using one or more of the following techniques!
            </p>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                <b>Pseudocode</b>: I really like using pseudocode to break down a problem when I don't see an immediate
                answer; it is particularly great when you don't really know what methods/functions you need to use
                to solve the problem. Once you have broken the solution down into stages, you can then google how to
                solve
                each particular step (e.g. how to capitalise a string using JavaScript).
            </p>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                <b>Googling</b>: Google is your friend. It is the first place I turn to when I need help with figuring
                out a problem. Blog posts on Medium are awesome for a more conceptual overview of how to approach a
                particular problem, while Stack Overflow is great for more specific code queries.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                <b>Console.logging</b>: I find this to be a great way to test what your code is doing at each step - and
                make sure it is actually doing what you think it is doing! It is also very helpful when trying to figure
                out why your code isn't working.
