        <h2 class="subtitle is-5 padding-0"><em>20 September 2019</em> </h2>

        <div class="blog-posts-body">
            <h3 class="title is-6">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I was interested to learn that self-regulation is considered to be a component of emotional
                intelligence; I had previously thought of this as a separate entity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                Having to write and share these blog posts has been the most challenging part. I personally don't find
                writing to be the most helpful reflection medium; I prefer to internalise my reflections and then talk
                things through with close friends and family. I also felt uncomfortable with having to share these posts
                online. If I am going to perform a reflective deep dive and uncover new things about myself, I am not
                going to be sharing these new personal findings online with strangers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I think that core skills are incredibly important in the workforce. Employers want to hire people who
                are personable and good at working in teams. Having empathy and compassion for others will go a long way
                in helping teams to work more effectively with less friction, with a resultant increase in workplace
                mood and productivity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should
                you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I do feel that there were definitely times that core learning felt like a waste of time; it was
                certainly the part of each sprint that I wanted to do the least. I am
                a reasonably introspective/reflective person - and while some of the learnings have been
                interesting, I don't really feel like it has changed my view of myself or the way in which I think.
