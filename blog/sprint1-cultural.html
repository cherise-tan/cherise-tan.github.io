            <h3 class="title is-6">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you
                weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the
                action you took.</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                A decision I have made as a dance business owner is the decision to allow dancers to swap
                traditional gendered roles in class. West Coast Swing is a partner dance style, where there is
                a (typically male) leader and a (typically female) follower. Other dance styles/studios have expressly
                forbidden males from following in class, because some male leaders have expressed dislike of having to
                dance with someone who is the same gender (there seems to be much less concern about female leaders).
                Their fear is of putting new students off the dance style (and subsequent financial implications from
                these individuals not attending dance classes). This goes against what our dance school values - we want
                to
                create a fun and inclusive environment in which our students feel safe to create and express themselves.
                We have normalised role-swapping in our classes, and have changed our vocabulary from "guys and girls"
                to "leaders and followers". We would rather have our community be accepting and inclusive than to change
                our values for a few newcomers who might feel uncomfortable dancing with someone of the same gender.

            <h3 class="title is-6">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                My parents are both immigrants to New Zealand, making me a first-generation New Zealander. My father is
                Chinese and grew up on a plantation in Malaysia as one of 14 children. My mother is mixed Sri
                Lankan/Dutch, and was raised in Australia. They learned that to progress in life, you have to be
                determined and to work hard, and this is a work ethic they have passed down to me. Being part of a small
                family unit (everyone outside of my immediate family lives overseas)
                has imparted the value of family and connection. Coming from such a mixed ethnic background, culture for
                me becomes a bit more confusing. Despite my heritage, I don't have much of a connection to my ethnic
                roots (apart from a love of Asian food!!). I identify as a New Zealander.

            <h3 class="title is-6">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career
                development. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I am a driven and fast learner who loves solving problems, which will help me along my learning journey
                as I pick up new concepts and technologies. Empathy is a core skill of mine - I love connecting with
                those around me, and often find myself in roles of counselling and mentorship. I take a lot of joy in
                helping to build up those around me. I am enthusiastic and outgoing, which I believe brings a great
                energy to a team - something which is quite important through such an intense course and in the
                worforce. I am also highly adaptable and used to a constantly changing environment, which I believe will
                do me well in the ever-changing world of technology.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                I do find that I have a strong need to prove myself and to excel in whatever I do, across all aspects of
                my life. While this drives me to succeed, it can also lead to significant stress and burnout, and to
                fluctuations in self-esteem when things don't pan out quite as intended. Having experienced burnout in
                my previous career, I am aware that this is something I am susceptible to - and I am setting goals
                around prioritising self-care because of this. I will also need to careful around balancing my time on
                course with my other commitments - in particular with running my dance business (I will need to have
                Tuesday evenings away from study for this).

            <h3 class="title is-6">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively
                with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how
                effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                One example that springs to mind comes from my time working in medicine. I was working with a particular
                consultant (senior doctor) who had a long reputation of bullying behaviour. I regularly had to conduct
                clinics with them, where I would review a patient and then report back to them to discuss the diagnosis
                and
                form a treatment plan. I learned that asking questions was a quick pathway to a negative experience.
                I knew that trying to get them to change their behaviour was futile (the many preceding years of
                complaints had yet to make a substantive change) - so I instead modified my own behaviour. They seemed
                to
                find
                direct questions threatening, as if I was questioning their clinical judgement. So I instead would ask
                gentler questions, stating that I "just wanted to make sure that I had understood correctly". Flipping
                questions around in this way led to much more comfortable work experiences. Given the power imbalance
                that
                existed in this work relationship, I feel that this was a helpful and appropriate strategy - and indeed
                I have given
                this
                advice to other doctors/students that went on to work with this consultant after me.
