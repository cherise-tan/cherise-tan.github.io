        <div class="blog-posts-body">
            <h3 class="title is-6">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                Neuroplasticity is the lifetime process of the brain reorganising itself by forming, strengthening and
                pruning neural connections. Changing concentrations of neurotransmitters result in a change in the
                connections between neurons, which can then eventually result in structural changes to the brain.
                The best driver of neuroplastic change is behaviour; practicing something will result in stronger neural
                pathways, while stopping practice will result in these pathways being pruned.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                Understanding that the brain continues to reorganise itself according to your behaviour, thoughts and
                emotions is empowering. Knowing that your brain is also shaped by the things that you don't do is
                equally important. This knowledge can help empower people to actively shape their brain's future
                development by establishing better habits and learning patterns.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Discuss how might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
            </h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                There are multiple ways in which to take control of the power of neuroplasticity:
                <ul class="margin-bottom">
                    <li>Set meaningful goals: knowing what you want to accomplish, and how you want to accomplish it, is
                        foundational to making real change</li>
                    <li>Continue learning and practicing new skills: increased struggle leads to greater learning, and
                        greater structural change in the brain</li>
                    <li>Adopt a growth mindset: you have the power to grow your abilities</li>
                    <li>Reduce stress: e.g. by practicing mindfulness/meditation</li>
                    <li>Have adequate sleep: sleep is required to reset brain connections that are important for
                        learning</li>
                    <li>Exercise: cardiovascular exercise boosts the supply of oxygen to the brain</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="title is-6">Discuss what a growth mindset is and why it is relevant</h3>
                <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                    Individuals with a growth mindset believe that their abilities (e.g. intelligence, personality) can
                    be grown through hard work and motivation. This allows them to take on challenges, rather than shy
                    away from them. By constantly striving to learn and grow, they are able to increase their skills.
                </p>
                <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                    Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities are static; that these are traits they
                    are born with which cannot be changed. This causes them to worry about the adequacy of these traits,
                    and drives a need for validation and to prove themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="margin-bottom">
                    <b> "Why waste time proving over and over how great you are when you could be getting better?"</b>
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-6">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning
                    plan and strategy</h3>
                <p class="margin-bottom">
                    I will integrate a growth mindset into
                    my learning by sinking into challenges rather than shying away from them, with the knowledge that
                    struggle means progress, and that my neural networks are growing. I will also help prime
                    my brain for learning by ensuring I get at least 8 hours of sleep per night,
                    engaging in regular exercise, and practicing self-care daily.
                </p>
