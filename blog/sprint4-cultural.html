        Neuroplasticity is a lifetime process of brain reorganisation by forming new neural connections

        Brain can change in three basic ways to support learning
        - Chemical: brain can increase concentrations of neurotransmitters. Occurs rapidly and therefore supports
        short-term memory or short-term improvement in a motor skill
        - Structure: brain can change the connections between neurons. Occurs over a longer period of time and are
        therefore related to long-term memory/improvements
        ○ Structural changes can lead to integrated networks of brain regions that function together to support
        learning, and can cause certain brain regions to change their structure or enlarge
        - Function: as a brain region is used, it becomes more excitable and easier to use again. This causes the brain
        to shift how and when these brain regions are activated.

        The best driver of neuroplastic change is behaviour, which requires large doses of practice
        - Increased struggle leads to greater learning and greater structural change in the brain
        - The brain is also being shaped by things that you don't do

        Anatomy
        - There are two major brain regions that have the ablity to continually give birth to new neurons in adults.
        This is because they have lots of granule cell neurons, which have the highest rate of neurogenesis
        ○ Hippocampus: long-term and spatial memory
        Cerebellum: coordination and muscle memory

            <h3 class="title is-6">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                The brain continues to reorganise itself through interactions with your environment, behaviour, thinking
                and emotions. Understanding this can empower people to actively shape their brain's future development.
                This can be utilised in recovery from brain injury, and also to help establish better habits and
                learning patterns.

            </h3>
            <p>
                I plan to work on adopting a growth mindset, getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night, engaging in
                regular exercise, and practicing self-care. This will help to prime my brain for learning.

                <h3 class="title is-6">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
                <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                    - Find clarity and motivation: knowing what you want to want to accomplish, and why you want to
                    accomplish it, is foundational to making real changes. This involves reflection on your personal
                    core values and priorities, to find what motivates you.
                    - Set meaningful goals and work towards these in micro-steps. It is better to take small steps daily
                    than to take on too much too quickly.
                    - Continue learning and practicing new skills
                    - Adopt a growth mindset: focus on the process, seek constructive criticism, stop seeking approval
                    - Sleep: required to reset brain connections that are important for memory and learning
                    - Exercise: cardiovascular exercises boost oxygen supply to the brain and increase brain volume
                    Reduce stress: e.g. By practicing mindfulness/meditation

                <h3 class="title is-6">Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant</h3>
                <p class="margin-bottom">
                    Individuals with a growth mindset believe that their most basic abilities (intelligence,
                    personality, moral character) can be developed through dedication and hard work. Brains and talent
                    are just the starting point. They take on challenges and learn from them, therefore increasing their
                    abilities and achievement. They are constantly trying to learn and grow to better themselves.

                    Individuals with a fixed mindset believe their traits are givens, and therefore worry about their
                    traits and how adequate they are. They have something to prove to themselves and others.

                    "Why waste time proving over and over how great you are when you could be getting better?"
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-6">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                    This has been an interesting reflection for me. I think I fall somewhere inbetween a fixed and
                    growth mindset. I certainly grew up defining myself by my intelligence and talents, however I don't
                    think I ever believed that these skills would not be improved by hard work. I certainly had a
                    tendency to not pursue things I did not immediately excel in - however I don't believe this was due
                    to feeling like it was impossible to improve my skills in these areas. I knew I could improve, but
                    did not want to put in the work. I think I felt that having to put in that work would show that I
                    was not instinctively great at something, and that was something that challenged my self-worth.

                </p>
                <p class="margin-bottom">
                    I would put down my need to prove myself more to lack of self confidence that was learned from a
                    young age, through experiences of being socially isolated and bullied in primary school. I felt the
                    need to prove to others that I was worthy of belonging, and that by displaying the things I was good
                    at, they would have to see that I was worthy of being part of their friendship group. I don't know
                    if this falls under the 'fixed mindset' umbrella - this requires further reflection...
