        <h1 class="title is-4 padding-1">HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the DOM</h1>

            <h3 class="title is-6">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                Let's imagine you're making a birthday card for a friend, but you're short on time. You grab a piece of
                blank A4 paper, fold it in half, and scrawl a birthday message on it using a black ball-point pen.
                This is HTML. It is structure and content, no frills attached.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                Let's now imagine you have a bit more time. You grab some coloured card, some different coloured pens,
                maybe try some calligraphy. You write the same birthday message as before.
                This is CSS. It does not change the message being delivered, but enhances the delivery by making it much
                more visually appealing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for
                example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
            <p>
                Control flow is the order in which various parts of a program are executed. Without specific control
                flow statements, a program will simply read from top to bottom. This can be altered by the use of
                specific control flow statements, which will result in a choice being made as to which path to follow.
                These can include loops and if-else statments. Loops will result in a particular piece of code being
                repeated until a particular condition is met. If-else statements result in a path being picked
                based on which specified condition has been met.</p>
            <p class="padding-2">
                An example of an if-else statement occurs when you are driving towards a traffic light. If the light is
                green, you can continue driving. Otherwise, if the light is yellow, you should slow down and prepare to
                stop. Otherwise the light is red, and you should stop before crossing the intersection.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">An example of a do-while loop is washing your car. You start washing your car, and
                continue washing it while the car is still dirty!
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                The DOM (Document Object Model) represents all the objects that make up the structure and content of a
                web document. By representing the document in a logical tree-like structure, it allows the browser to
                make sense of and interact with the document it is displaying.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                It provides the missing link between your HTML/CSS and your JavaScript, allowing JavaScript to access
                and modify the document and its elements. This may include adding/removing elements, setting inline CSS
                styles, and responding to mouse clicks/hovers etc.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
            <p class="padding-bottom-2">
                When accessing data from an array, you use indexes - e.g. <code>[0]</code>. Each index references a
                particular position in the array. Counting begins at 0, therefore the first index (position) of an array
                will be <code>array[0]</code>, and the second will be <code>array[1]</code> etc.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                When accessing data from an object, you can use either bracket notation e.g.
                <code>object.property</code> or dot notation e.g. <code>object['property']</code>. If the property has a
                space in its name, you must use bracket notation e.g. <code>object['property name']</code>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
            <p class="margin-bottom">
                A function is a block of code that is designed to accomplish a particular task. A function can be
                defined with parameters - basically placeholders for the values that will be passed to it when the
                function is called. For example: <code>function add(x, y) { return x + y }</code>. In this example, 'x'
                and 'y' are parameters. When functions are called, they can provide arguments to the
                function - e.g. <code>add(1, 2);</code>. In this example, '1' and '2' are arguments. The use of
                parameters and arguments allow functions to be reused with different data values - minimising the need
                for repeating similar code.
